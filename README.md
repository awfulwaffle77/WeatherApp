# Yet Another Weather App

A JavaFX GUI Application written in (**YOU GUESSED IT!**) Java. The countries and cities are read from the file in 
`resources/cities.txt` as requested.

## First things to know

- Maven was not used in the development of this application, because I wanted to get more familiar with .jars and IntelliJ.

- The project respects the MVC architecture

- In the first commit, the API key was deleted from source, but I have later added it, because you shouldn't bother with 
getting an API Key.
